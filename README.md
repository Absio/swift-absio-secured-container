# Absio Swift SDK

Absio Swift SDK is a part of Absioâ€™s developer toolset which developers can use to build PKI-based authentication and data-level encryption directly into software applications and services, without having to manage keys and certificates, add hardware, or rely on a third-party service. 

## Basics 
General technology overview and toolset can be found [here](http://docs.absio.com/#technologytools)

## Requirements

- iOS 12.0 and higher
- macOs 10.14 and higher
- Xcode 11.7 and higher
- Swift 5 and higher

## Installation 
Currently we are supporting CocoaPods. 
If you are new to using pods please visit getting started [page](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

To get our pod instantly please use line below

```ruby
pod 'AbsioSDK', '~> 1.0.0'
```

#### **Note:**
We are distributing fat libraries to support both simulator and different architectures. If you have any **issues with validation/submitting** your application to App Store, please insert content of [cut-architectures.sh](cut-architectures.sh) into 'Build Phases' of your application with 'New Run Script Phase'. This will strip unused architectures for simulators and validation should then go smooth.
